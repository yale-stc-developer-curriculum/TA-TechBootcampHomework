## Deaf Grandma Redux

You are to complete the same Deaf Grandma assignment as before, but now in Javascript!!

- This time, we are not providing a skeleton for you. You are to write a while loop to repeatedly prompt for the user's input and display Deaf Grandma's response.

Here are the specifications (same as before):
- Whatever you say to grandma (whatever you type in), she should respond with "HUH?! SPEAK UP, SONNY!" , unless you shout it (type in all capitals).
- If you shout, she can hear you (or at least she thinks so) and yells back, "NO, NOT SINCE 19XX!"  
  - Have grandma shout a different year at random between 1930 and 1950.
- You can't stop talking to grandma until you shout BYE. Except she doesn't want you to leave, so you have to shout BYE three times in a row.
  - The first two times she should respond "Don't go..."
  - On the third bye, the program should exit.
