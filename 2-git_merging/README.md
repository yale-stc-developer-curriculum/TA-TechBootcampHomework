##GitHub Assignment -- Favorites
- Divide into 6 teams; each with 5 people.

1. Start by cloning the 'favorites' repository (https://github.com/yale-stc-developer-curriculum/favorites) onto your computer.
2. Pick a team name and one person should **create a new branch** for your team. Push the branch to origin. 
3. Other team members should pull this branch and switch to it.  Now we're ready to roll.
4. Each person on your team should create one of the following files, add their favorites of that category to the file, and save it to your branch:
  1. food.txt
  2. music.txt
  3. tv-movies.txt
  4. experiences.txt
  5. random.txt
    - *add at least 3-4 favorites in your file*
    - *make sure these are the names of your files*
    - *files must be text-based, but feel free to include links, quotations, etc.*
4. Commit and push your changes.  *(Hint: You'll need to pull / merge as you go... don't try to all push at the same time.)*
5. Everybody should pull your updated branch.
6. Now comes the fun part. Pick a different file than you were working on before and change away. Add your favorites. Delete your friend's favorites. Reorder things, duplicate things, make a little mess.
  - *Once again, everybody should be working on a different file.*
7. Commit and push your changes.
8. **Repeat steps 5-7** until everyone has had a chance to make their changes to every file.
9. Your branch should be done. Pat yourself on the back.
10. Find another team who has also finished and merge your branch with theirs.  Merge that into another team's branch.
11. Once the class is happy with it's creation, merge the final branch to master.
12. Admire your creation. And the magic of GitHub making it possible
