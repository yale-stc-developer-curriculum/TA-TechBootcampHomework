##RPS Team Pages
1. This is an expercise in pair programming! You and your partner (as found below) are a rock-paper-scissors (RPS) team.
2. Working with your partner, your assignment is to create a website for your RPS team. Please include at least 10 types of HTML tags and 10 different CSS styles.
3. Some basic rules (guidelines):
  1. Come up with a team name!
  2. Use the template files (`index.html` and `style.css`) on the `master` branch to get started.
  3. Please create a new branch for your team of 2 and build your website there.
    - You can preview your changes locally. Just open up your `index.html` file in a browser!
    - To preview your website on GitHub, append `http://htmlpreview.github.io/?` in front of the index.html file you wish to preview.
    - For example to preview https://github.com/yale-stc-developer-curriculum/rock-paper-scissors/blob/my-branch/index.html, just enter the URL: http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/yale-stc-developer-curriculum/rock-paper-scissors/blob/my-branch/index.html
  4. Your website can include *whatever* you want, just please try to keep the original HTML template somewhat intact...
5. Now comes the fun part! **TIME TO MERGE**
  1. You and your partner are to merge your website with the two other teams in your conference. (Each conference has 3 teams, see below). Please create this merged website **on a new branch**.
  2. Work as a team of 6 to make the merged website pretty. See if you can resolve the merge conflicts and bring the website together in some form of coherent fashion. After all, *it is the conference website.* 
  3. Get pumped for the **ultimate** rock, paper, scissors tournament ever!
