# tenders_rand() => "Nope."

# Specification
# write a function lunch(day) that returns a different (your choice) meal for

# Examples
# lunch("Saturday") => "fish"

# lunch("SUNDAY") => "steak"

# write a function tenders_num(num) that will return "It's Chicken Tenders Day!"
# if the num represents the date of a Thursday, assuming the month starts with 
# Sunday the 1st. 

# Otherwise, tenders_num(num) should return

# month is on the *start* date.

# Otherwise, tenders_adv(num) should return

# Hint: You can use tenders_num(num)
# Examples
# tenders_adv(1, 5) => "It's Chicken Tenders Day!"
# tenders_adv(2) => "You have 3 days to go."
# tenders_adv(12) => "It's Chicken Tenders Day!"
# tenders_adv(6) => "You have 6 days to go."

# Specification:
# Same as specifications for tenders_adv(start,num), except now write a function

# month is on the *start* date.
# Day should be a case-insensitive day of the week.

# Otherwise, tenders_adv(num) should return

# tenders_ultimate(1, 5, "Thursday") => "It's Chicken Tenders Day!"
# tenders_ultimate(3, 8, "Monday") => "You have 6 days to go."
# tenders_ultimate(5, 19, "Wednesday") => "You have 3 days to go.""
