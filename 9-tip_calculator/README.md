#Tip Calculator Assignment
Your assignment is the complete the Tip Calculator web app.  Tip Calculator is built using Sinatra, a framework for web-development -- we will be learning it later!!

Most of the work has been done. The app successfully prompts users for the items they've ordered.  It then calculates the subtotal and prompts users for the tax rate and percentage tip they would like to leave.

Users then click Calculate! and are taken to the next page. Here's where the app is incomplete. At this point, Tip Calculator displays a table with the results -- but the results are meaningless (no calculations have been performed!).

Your assignment is to add the appropriate calculations to this app and in doing so, complete its functionality.

#Instructions
- You are to edit the_math.rb. There are four functions defined there, yet none of them have been completed.  Insert the appropriate calculations so as to complete the functions. Instructions on what each function should do are found in the file itself.

#Running Tip Calculator
- First, you need the appropriate gems: run `bundle install`. This will install Sinatra.
- Change to the appropriate directory and run `ruby tip_calculator.rb`. Visit [localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567) in your browser.
