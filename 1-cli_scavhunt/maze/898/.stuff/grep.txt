Your mission: Find every line in the file 'haystack.txt' containing the word 'needle'. Good luck... This'll be like looking for a needle in a haystack. (They see me trolling...)

But thankfully unix shells come with a tool for just that! Use the command

$ grep REGEX FILE

to search for the pattern REGEX in FILE, line by line.

What's a pattern? It gets a little complicated, so we won't go too much into these patterns we call 'regular expressions' right now (although you can ask us later!). Basically, regular expressions are patterns that match lines of text in files. But grep can be used as a simple string search tool when you're just looking for a string of letters in a file. Look for lines containing the string "needle" in the file haystack.txt. Since this will return lots of text, let's just output the number of lines that match 'needle'. Grep has a flag '-c' that will do just this. Then pipe the output of grep into the script. Remember that the syntax for piping is as follows:

$ COMMAND1 | COMMAND2
