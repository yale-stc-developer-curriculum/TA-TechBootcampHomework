There are two scripts in this directory! What's going on?

Well the first script (script6.sh) spits out a jumble of nonsense text. The second script (script7.sh) is looking for some password. I wonder what would happen if script6.sh could feed its nonsense text into script7.sh...

We'll try just that! How? Well in bash (the shell your presumably running in your terminal window), you can use the '|' character (called a 'pipe') to pipe the output of one command into another command as its input. The usage of '|' goes like this:

$ COMMAND1 | COMMAND2

Since we have a script that likes talking and one that likes listening, we'll link them together with '|'. Try it out and see what happens!
