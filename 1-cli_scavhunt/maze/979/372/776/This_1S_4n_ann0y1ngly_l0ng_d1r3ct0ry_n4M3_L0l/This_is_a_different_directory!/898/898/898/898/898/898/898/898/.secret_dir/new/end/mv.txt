Now that you know how to copy files, let's move a file! Entering the command

$ mv FIlENAME DESTINATION

will move FILENAME to DESTINATION. Try moving the file 'morestuff.txt' into the 'box' directory! Then run the script in this directory again.

P.S. You can also use mv to rename a file like so:

$ mv NAME1 NAME2

This will write the contents of the file NAME1 to a new file NAME2.
