Dead end for real this time?

You try running 'ls -a' and find that there's nothing but this script file in the current directory?

Have no fear! To keep going, we'll have to make a new directory 'new' using the command

$ mkdir new

Once you've created this directory (check with ls!), run the script 'script.sh' by running the command

$ sh script.sh

and you'll get further instructions!
