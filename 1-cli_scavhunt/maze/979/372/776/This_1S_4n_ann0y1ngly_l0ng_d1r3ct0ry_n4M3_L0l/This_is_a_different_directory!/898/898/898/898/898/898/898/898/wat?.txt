Well hello!

It looks like we've hit a dead end! But have we?

Try the command

$ ls

to see a list of the files and directories in the current directory. Still looks like nothing's in this directory, right?

Now try running the same command with a new flag:

$ ls -a

The flag '-a' will tell the terminal to list the hidden contents of the current directory alongside the visible stuff!

P.S. Hidden files and directories are the ones whose names begin with a '.' but there's really nothing special about them. Often, files and directories are hidden to prevent the user from accidentally modifying or deleting them.
