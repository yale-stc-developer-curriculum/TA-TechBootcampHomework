Whew!

A bit annoying typing the same command over and over again, eh?

But there's an easier way! If your previous command was

$ cd 898

then hit the up arrow key and you'll see

$ cd 898

pop back onto your command line! You can view your previously entered commands by hitting the up arrow key. Try using this command to proceed.
