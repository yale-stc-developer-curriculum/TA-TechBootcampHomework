Welcome!

To figure out where you are in your directory tree, type the command

$ pwd

Note that the '$' represents your command prompt (i.e., it's how your terminal can tell you it's waiting for a command), so you shouldn't type out the '$' when trying a command. So in this case, just write 'pwd' and hit enter!

Psst! Throughout this maze of directories, you'll notice some .txt files that may or may not contain useful information. Typing the command

$ cat FILENAME

will output the contents of FILENAME to your terminal for reading. You can also use any of the command line editors (e.g., vim, nano, less) to view the contents of a plaintext file, although for this exercise, you'll only need to use cat.

After you do this, type 'cd' followed by the name of the directory 979 to get to your next set of instructions!
