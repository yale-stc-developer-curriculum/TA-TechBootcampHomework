## Ruby Kata

- to test your code, navigate to the appropriate directory (`4-ruby_exercises/`)
- open irb on the command line
- type `load './kata.rb'` to load in the code.
	- to test a function, just call the function:
	- ie, just type `greet('Charlie')`
- whenever you make changes, you need to `load './kata.rb'` again
